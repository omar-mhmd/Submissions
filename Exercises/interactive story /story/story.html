              "I never thought life functions in a weird manner. What is life? What is Death? Believe it or not, with a blink of an eye everything fades away..."

          <p>Woke up one summer vacation and ready to pump up my summer vacation. After a long year doing physics and computational researches, I was on the brink of cracking up. My wife and I had plans to go hiking at St. Marie Mountain. We had set up everything a week prior to our journey. On that specific day, we set out to seek nature, unaware that nature had plans for our visits.</p>
          <p>The unexpected happened at that time as soon as my wife and I were hiking up a narrow path, she slipped and fell over the hill. I agitated, my mind went blank as my body wouldn't move. I stood there frozen in fear when I directly zapped out of it and called an ambulance.</p>
          <p>Aid came in time however, it was late. My wife couldn't make it, she got a head concussion and her brain stopped working. My most precious thing in life has fled away.</p>
          <p>When I discovered that by merging the four types of forces Gravitational, Electromagnetic and Nucleur, you can create a portal that takes you back in time. It wasn't easy at first, however, after doing some researches I think it was possible.</p>  
          <p>My family were against my researches, everyone guided me to move on, but they don't know the pain of losing someone, not the pain of watching someone die in front of your eyes. What I experienced was something no one would understand, but, from a different perspective, my idea was crazy risky which I may not return in one piece.</p>
