    <div class="par1">
        <p>I was always fascinated with PCs.
            Coming from a background of family who has no prior knowledge in PCs or had prior internet knowledge,
            I had to learn most of the stuff by myself.
            I never got Internet until I was probably a teenager and have learned everything myself, that I became known in my family as the tech wiz.
            At the age of 15, I joined Wikia Fandoms and became an admin, during that time I was introduced to CSS and what hacking the code meant.
            I also learned what HTML meant and became familiar with most of the basics.
            My passion during that time was designing as I really did enjoy making aesthetically pleasing css templates.
